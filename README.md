Dataverse 
==========

Dataverse is an open source web application for sharing, citing, analyzing, and preserving research data (developed by the [Data Science team] (http://datascience.iq.harvard.edu/about-dataverse) at the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science] (http://iq.harvard.edu/)).

Institutions and organizations can choose to install the Dataverse software for their own use. 
In this case, the institution will be responsible for maintaining the application; installing upgrades, 
setting up backups and data replication as needed. Dataverse 4.0 is now released and used by the Harvard Dataverse: [dataverse.harvard.edu] (http://dataverse.harvard.edu/). If you'd like to first test it, you can use our demo site: [dataverse-demo.iq.harvard.edu] (http://dataverse-demo.iq.harvard.edu/).
